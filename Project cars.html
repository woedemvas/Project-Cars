                <h2>Car 1: Porsche 911 GT3 RS</h2>

This car is acclaimed for its exceptional handling, aerodynamics, and track capabilities. The GT3 RS has a naturally aspirated flat six-engine, which offers impressive power output. Additionally, the GT3 RS, with its impressive performance, travels from 0-60 mph in just 3 seconds, with a top speed of 184 mph and a 518 horsepower.

                <h2>Car 3: 2021 Lamborghini Huracan STO</h2>
                <p>Lamborghini is known for having most of its models looking similar to each other. However, this car stands out to me with its design and performance.

The Huracan STO is constructed with lightweight materials such as carbon fiber, which contributes to its impressive performance. As a track car, The STO is a rear-wheel-drive with a built-in V10 engine. The design of the car is what brings my attention, and so I put this at the bottom of the top 3 cars.</p>
